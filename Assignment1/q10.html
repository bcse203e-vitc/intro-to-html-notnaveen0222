    <h1>Football</h1>
    <hr class="solid">    
    <p>Football, also called association football or soccer, is a game involving two teams of 11 players who try to maneuver the ball into the other team's goal without using their hands or arms. The team that scores more goals wins. Football is the world's most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators.
        Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the games status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester College, Charterhouse, and Eton College. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not.
