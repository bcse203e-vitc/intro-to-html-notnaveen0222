    <h1>Paragraph1</h1>
    <p > &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. </p>
    <h1>Paragraph2</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
